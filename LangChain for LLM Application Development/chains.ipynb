As the temperature increases, the peak intensity of the radiation shifts to shorter wavelengths, resulting in a change in color from red to orange, yellow, white, and eventually blue at very high temperatures.\\n\\nBlack body radiation is a fundamental concept in physics and has significant applications in various fields, including astrophysics, thermodynamics, and quantum mechanics.

It serves as a blueprint for the production of specific proteins that determine the characteristics and traits of an organism. Additionally, DNA is responsible for the transmission of genetic information from one generation to the next during reproduction. Therefore, every cell in our body contains DNA to ensure the proper functioning and continuity of life.'"
