The editors of the Arden Shakespeare question the idea of \"source hunting\", pointing out that it presupposes that authors always require ideas from other works for their own, and suggests that no author can have an original idea or be an originator. When Shakespeare wrote there were many stories about sons avenging the murder of their fathers, and many about clever avenging sons pretending to be foolish in order to outsmart their foes. This would include the story of the ancient Roman, Lucius Junius Brutus, which Shakespeare apparently knew, as well as the story of Amleth, which was preserved in Latin by 13th-century chronicler Saxo Grammaticus in his \"Gesta Danorum\", and printed in Paris in 1514. The Amleth story was subsequently adapted and then published in French in 1570 by the 16th-century scholar François de Belleforest. It has a number of plot elements and major characters in common with Shakespeare\\'s \"Hamlet\", and lacks others that are found in Shakespeare. Belleforest\\'s story was first published in English in 1608, after \"Hamlet\" had been written, though it\\'s possible that Shakespeare had encountered it in the French-language version.', 'title': 'Hamlet', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13554', 'views': 3000}, {'_additional': {'distance': -154.56943}, 'lang': 'en', 'text': 'English poet John Milton was an early admirer of Shakespeare and took evident inspiration from his work.

While Milton did not ultimately go that route, the poem still shows distinct echoes of Shakespearean revenge tragedy, and of \"Hamlet\" in particular. As scholar Christopher N. Warren argues, \"Paradise Lost\"s Satan \"undergoes a transformation in the poem from a Hamlet-like avenger into a Claudius-like usurper,\" a plot device that supports Milton\\'s larger Republican internationalist project. The poem also reworks theatrical language from \"Hamlet\", especially around the idea of \"putting on\" certain dispositions, as when Hamlet puts on \"an antic disposition,\" similarly to the Son in \"Paradise Lost\" who \"can put on / [God\\'s] terrors.\"', 'title': 'Hamlet', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13554', 'views': 3000}, {'_additional': {'distance': -154.2872}, 'lang': 'en', 'text': \"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark, often shortened to Hamlet (), is a tragedy written by William Shakespeare sometime between 1599 and 1601.
